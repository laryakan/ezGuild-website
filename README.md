ezGuildSite
===========

![gnu-knight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laryakan/ezGuildSite/master/frontend/img/banner273x296.png)

A "ready to use" guild website for gamer communities. This website will be the simpliest you ever seen.

For now we only have the frontend. To launch the static part of the site, type `npm start`, and to stop it `npm stop`
  
The frontend static part will be launch on 127.0.0.1:8080 (using node-static)

I will develop the backend part using node.js (imo), features will be:
- Submit a request to guild master/officier
- Accept new member
- Registering guild members
- Kick guild member

Then :
- Multi guild support
- Multi games support

All this through a rest API, maybe using something like elasticsearch.

Going forward, I'll maybe develop some more features like organizing event according to the Guild Wars 2 public API (or other games) + elasticsearch. Depending on motivation.

Anyway, this site will be [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)-like for any user on it.
